			<h4>Don't give up!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, you will make mistakes and you will get frustrated. You might think that you'll never get it. That's when you need to keep going. It helps sometimes to take a break and do something completely unrelated. Go for a walk. Get a snack. But come back! You have to keep pushing forward if you want to get better.</p>

			<h4>Read other people's code.</h4>
			<p>One of the greatest things about programming is that there are usually countless solutions to a problem. If you want to think of new ways to solve a particular coding problem, take a look at other people's solutions to the same problem. Everyone solves them in their own way and sometimes you can discover new ways of approaching your own code. Getting used to reading others' code is just as valuable as writing your own.</p>
